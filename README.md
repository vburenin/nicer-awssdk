# Nicer AWS SDK

Amazon released Golank SDK for AWS. Unfortunately, SDK is really low level
that significantly slows down a development process just to do repetable things
over and over again.

To make things a little better, this library provides some common usage patterns
on top of the official AWS SKD greatly simplifying developers life.

All contributions are very welcome.
